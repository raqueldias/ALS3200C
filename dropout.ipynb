        "\n",
        "\"Overfitting\" can occur when the model you are using to analyze your data is 'too complex' for the amount of data you have available for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the 'complexity' of a neural network model is roughly proportional to the number of 'free parameters' in the model (the network's \"weights\" and \"biases\").\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we can make a neural network model 'simpler' (and thereby reduce it's likelihood of overfitting) by *removing* free parameters from the model (ie, reduce the number of weights and biases in the model).\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind \"dropout\" is to reduce the number of free parameters in the model *during training* by *randomly* removing (or \"dropping out\") a user-specified proportion of neurons (along with their weights and biases) from the network during each training step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptually, the user specifies the 'probability' or 'frequency' with which neurons are 'removed' from the network during training. Typically, a 'dropout probability' of between 0.2-0.5 is used in practice, meaning that 20%-50% of the network's neurons are randomly 'removed' during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "At each training step, neurons are effectively deleted from the network with the user-specified probability. The 'reduced' network is then trained for a single step using forward- and back-propagation, and the network's remaining parameters are updated, based on the gradients and the specific optimizer used to train the network. During the *next* training step, a *new* set of neurons are 'randomly deleted' from the network, and the *new* 'reduced' network is trained and updated. This 'stochastic' process is repeated throughout the *entire* training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "During inference or 'prediction', however, *all* the neurons in the network are included. This includes evaluation of overfitting using validation data. During model validation, the *entire network* is used; dropout is *only* used when fitting the model to the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original paper on 'dropout' from 2012 is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580).\n",
