        "So far, we have learned how to fit a 1-dimensional linear neural network to data using tensorflow. As is the case with most 'general' computational frameworks, there is a fair amount of code needed to just implement a linear model using a neural network. Perhaps this particular framework is a bit of 'over kill' for simple 1D linear modeling? However, by using a general framework to implement and fit our model, it makes extending our model to higher dimensions *much* easier.\n",
