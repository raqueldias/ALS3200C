        "The final course project is designed to be an open-ended and 'creative' analysis of microbial community data, with the goal of training a model to predict autoimmune disease risk from microbiome data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data intake and packaging pipeline is coded for you in the following code cell; it includes the addition of 'location' information in the sequence data, so it can be directly used in transformer models.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using the same microbial community data that was used in week 12, and you will be required to implement a transformer model similar to the one we implemented in week 13, so you may want to review the material from those weeks before getting started.\n",
        "\n",
        "But this final project is a chance for you to 'play around' with *all* the various tools and techniques we've looked at throughout this course, so take a little time to reflect on some of the problems and approaches we've worked on; these are all 'tools' you can use for data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The grade for the final project will be based on a structured 'write up' of what you do in this jupyter notebook. This is a chance for you to explore the concepts and techniques we've introduced in this course in more detail, and get points for doing so. So think creatively!\n",

        "I'd recommend exploring ideas and analysis options by conducting a series of 'experiments' or data analyses. In each 'experiment', you make a *change* to *how* you are analyzing the data. You might use a different optimizer, or add another layer to your network. *Which* changes you make should be guided by *questions* or *problems* you encounter. For example, your model's accuracy might be low, and you might try to *improve* accuracy by adding a new layer to your network. For another example, if you observe overfitting in your model, you might try adding a regularizer to reduce overfitting. You then observe the *effect* of each change you make on the data analysis, so you can evaluate what the change does. For example, does adding another layer to the network improve accuracy? Does it also increase overfitting?\n",

        "2. What exactly did you *do*? What changes did you make that you want to assess?\n",
        "3. What happened? What information or 'data' was collected during your analysis or experiment?\n",
        "4. What did the 'results' of your experiment or analysis *tell you* that is *relevant* to answering the question that prompted you to perform this experiment or analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Every time you do an analysis or change something about the way you are modeling or analyzing the data, keep track of your answers to questions 1-4 above, and then you can use that information for your final project write up."

You could also try removing the normalization layers in your model, to see if layer normalization is needed.\n",

        "Finally, you might want to consider comparing the transformer model to alternative sequence models for this problem. How does the transformer model's accuracy compare to the accuracy of a Conv1D or LSTM model? Which models are faster to train? Which models have more trainable parameters? Are any models inherently more/less susceptible to overfitting? You might want to also try testing variants of Conv1D and LSTM that *include* the linear projection layer that projects your data into a high-dimensional representational space, so the results are more 'comparable' between the transformer and the other sequence models."
