        "Well, in this case there are some back-end optimizations that significantly speed up LSTM training. In particular, specific combinations of options allow LSTM training to take advantage of NVIDIA's cuDNN library for neural network training, which is very fast. So long as you are happy with the default LSTM parameters, you can run LSTM training much faster than the simpler SimpleRNN model."
