        "\n",
        "Technically \"dimension\" is a bit off. Really, we should be thinking about the \"rank\" of the \"array\" or \"tensor\". A \"tensor\" is a mathematical object that has 'magnitude' (a number) in multiple 'directions'. The number of possible simultaneous 'directions' is the tensor's \"rank\".\n",

The second rank of the matrix is used to hold the scalars in each vector; its dimensionality is the number of scalars in each vector (ie, the dimensionality of the vector).

The value of each number gives the dimensionality of the corresponding rank. In our example, then, there are 4 tensors in the first rank of the overall tensor, so the dimensionality of the first rank is 4. Each of the items in the first rank (they are technically matrices, but we can just call them \"tensors\") holds 3 items, so the dimensionality of the second rank is 3. Finally, there is a single scalar value in the inner-most square brackets, so the dimensionality of the third rank is 1.\n",

The \"tensorflow\" library is just a library that provides super-fast, GPU-accelerated operations on \"tensors\". Because so many things in AI are just operations on tensors, we can use tensorflow to do AI-related things super-fast, which is good for us!"

        "Recall that the basic procedure in neural network training starts with a neural network having values for *all* the weights in the network. Initially, these weights are 'randomly initialized' to starting values. A 'single pass' through the training procedure calculates the loss function, given the current weights of the network, calculates the gradients, and then uses the gradients (and the optimizer) to 'update' the model's weights, providing new weights for the next pass through the training process.\n",

        "There are two 'extreme' answers to this question. First, we could decide to only analyze 1 training data sample, and then *immediately* update the model's weights, based on just this one training sample. This approach is quick, because we update the model's weights from just one calculation. Unfortunately, this approach also tends to suffer from a 'noisy gradients' problem. Remember that estimating values from *a single data point* is almost *never* a good idea, statistically! Using this single-data-update approach, the gradients tend to have trouble 'pointing in the right direction' due to statistical noise, so the optimizer can have a lot of trouble optimizing the model!\n",
        "\n",
        "The alternative 'extreme' approach is to only update the model's weights after analyzing *every* training data sample. This approach could be called \"epoch based training\", as an \"epoch\" refers to the model analyzing *every* sample in the training data set once. (In the literature, \"epoch based training\" is often referred to as \"batch training\", which is *very* confusing, but you should be aware of this terminology). Epoch-based training tends to be more 'stable' than updating the weights after each data sample is analyzed, because the gradients tend to be more well-behaved when averaged over *many* data samples (so, statistics works!). The *major* down-side to the epoch-based approach is that you have to do *a lot* of computation for *each* weight update, so model fitting takes *a lot* more time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'compromise' between single-data and epoch-based training is what I will call \"batch based training\" (it is very often called \"mini-batch training\" in the literature and online). In the batch based approach, the user selects a value for the \"batch size\", which determines *how many* training data samples the model will analyze *before* updating its weights once. Obviously, the *smallest* possible batch size is 1 (equivalent to single-data training), and the *largest* possible batch size is the size of the entire training data set (equivalent to epoch-based training). Setting a batch size somewhere between these two extremes allows the user to 'balance' gradient stabilization (larger batch size stabilizes the gradients used to update the weights) vs computational efficiency (smaller batch size produces *more* gradient updates, per calculation).\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, common batch sizes are typically between 32 and 256 for *most* neural network training applications. And yes, they are *very often* a power of 2! Computer programmers *love* powers of 2, and the AI folks are no different (probably *more* so!). The *really nice* thing about powers of 2 is that you can *always* divide it in half! This can be *really* useful when, for example, you'd like to efficiently up-sample or down-sample some image data; you *always* know you can do it without having to do any weird pixel interpolations. In any case, be prepared to see (and use) many powers-of-2 if you do any work in AI :)\n",
        "\n",
        "The way batch-based training works is... You divide your training data set into 'batches' of user-specified size. So, say we set a batch size of 10; that means we'll divide our data into 'chunks' of size 10 data samples. We still say that a pass through the *entire* data set is an \"epoch\", but now our \"epoch\" has been divided into \"batches\" of a fixed size (10, in our case).\n",
        "\n",
        "To update our model's weights, we first pass *all* the data samples *in a single batch* through our model. Remember that \"None\" dimension in our model summary? That \"None\" dimension allows tensorflow to process an entire batch as a single unit, which makes it *much* faster! In our example, 10 data samples will be packaged and passed through our model as a single unit. The model then calculates the loss over the entire batch (all 10 samples), calculates the gradients across the entire batch, and then uses the batch-gradients to update the model's weights (via the optimizer).\n",

        "However, due to the 'stochastic' nature of neural network training, we cannot *guarantee* that this is *precisely* the 'best-fit' line to these data! Neural network training is *only* an *approximation* to model parameter 'optimization'; it is not guaranteed to give you the actual optimal results. There are other algorithms that *are guaranteed* to give you optimal results, and for linear models they are *much* faster than neural network training. So, why would we *ever* use a *slower* method that is also *not as good*?\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason we 'prefer' stochastic optimization is that it \"scales\" much better to larger problems. Once the number of parameters in the model starts getting large, or the model becomes non-linear by adding non-linear activations, stochastic optimization methods like neural network training suddenly become both *much faster* and *much more accurate* than methods that work better in low-dimensional problems. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, while there are 'better' ways to fit a linear model than stochastic gradient descent, the training method we chose 'generalizes better' to larger models, so it's worth it to learn it. As we'll see later on, fitting more complex models is *the same* in tensorflow, so we *won't* need to learn much more code, and we can concentrate on actually building cool and useful models."
