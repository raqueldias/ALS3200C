        "# collecting more data to mitigate overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "When possible, collecting more training data can be an effective strategy to help mitigate model overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, collecting more data allows you to keep the other aspects of the model and the training process the same. In many cases, data scientists develop a specific statistical model in order to address a particular question or hypothesis. There may be a good reason to use the model you are using to perform an analysis, and simplifying the model in order to match the amount of available training data might negatively impact the information you can get out of the modeling process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, data normalization and model regularization techniques can effectively mitigate model overfitting, but they can also alter the best-fit values of the model's parameters, which can impact the interpretability of the results. In many cases, the *values* of the model's parametes can have *meaning* within the problem domain. Researchers use the fitted values of model parameters to help them better understand the structure of the data and how it relates to important concepts in the field of study. In some cases, the model's parameter values are *more* important to a particular study objective than other features of the model. Data normalization and model regularization (we'll look at them in more detail later on) can alter the model's parameter values, which can make them less informative.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a computational modeling perspective, collecting more data is *easy*; the only downside is that the training process will take more time, because more training samples need to be evaluated during each training epoch. In the 'real world', however, collecting additional data can be *extremely* costly and time-consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help side-step the additional costs associated with collecting more data in the real world, many studies try to incorporate new data from *other* existing studies that are using similar data to address similar questions. This approach of incorporating different data from multiple different studies is sometimes called a \"meta-analysis\" approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "While meta-analysis can be an effective strategy for increasing the *amount* of training data samples, it can also raise new data analysis problems. In nearly all cases, data from different studies is, well... different. Various studies can differ in their sampling strategies, in the precise data fields being collected, in the types of subjects or sites from which data are collected, and in how the data samples are organized, processed and evaluated for quality. All these differences across studies can introduce complex 'heterogeneity' into the combined meta-data set. If data from multiple sources is not carefully integrated, it can cause *huge* problems for data analysis, including analysis using neural networks."

        "\n",
        "Many research studies 'evolve' over time, often shifting focus as the study proceeds. This is a very poor practice from a data-analysis point of view, and it is often actively discouraged by statisticians and data scientists. However, it is part of doing research and often can't be avoided. Many research studies don't even *consult* data analysis experts until *after* data have been collected. This is extremely frustrating for data scientists and can severely limit the types of analyises that can be reliably conducted, limiting the value of the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, data scientists should be *part* of the research team from the very beginning. Data analysts understand what can and can't be done with data. Getting their input on study design *before* data are collected helps ensure that the data that are collected will be appropriate to reliably support the goals of the study and avoid any technical analysis problems that could undermine the statistical validity of the results. Fortunately, including data-science 'experts' in early study development is increasingly becoming 'standard practice' in scientific and industry research."

        "\n",
        "One simple thing that data scientists can do to help mitigate potential overfitting *before* data are collected is to evaluate the *amount* of training data required to reduce overfitting of a specified neural network model using simulated data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional statistics, as \"power analysis\" is often done before a research study, in order to determine the number of data samples required to reliably detect an effect of the expected magnitude. This type of analysis places a *lower bound* on the amount of data samples a study should collect. The result of a power anlaysis basically tells the research team that they *must* collect *at least* this number of data samples to have any hope of reliably identifying the effect they hypothesize they will observe. This type of approach is most appropriate to use when the statistical model is *very* simple; it doesn't directly address potential overfitting when the model is complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use an approach similar to 'power analysis' to help identify, given a specified neural network model, how much data we need to collect to effectively reduce model overfitting during the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, we simply simulate training data sets of increasing sizes and evaluate the neural network model's overfitting using a training-validation data split. The *smallest* data set for which model overfitting is reduced to a sufficiently low amount represents the *minimum* amount of data we would need to collect to mitigate overfitting. In practice, this approach relies on our ability to simulate training data similar to the 'real' data we expect to collect."
